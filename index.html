                "King of Space. Master of the Sun. You claim such vast domains. Is it to balance your small souls? Could
                I not lay claim to the light and the void, if I wished it? Have I not earned such titles? I, who have
                mastered all arts, all sciences, all secrets? Whose technology and magic cross the stars as easily as
                they scramble an alpha telepath's mind? Who would dare to say I have not earned the right? Yet I am king
                of a simple nation. On a simple planet. A beloved garden tended by iron hands. And the only title I have
                ever claimed...is Doctor.<br>

            <h3 id="headline">Doctor Doom's Motivation:</h3>
            <p align=left>In various Marvel Comics storylines, Doctor Doom has often been portrayed
                as a complex
                character who
                grapples with his ambitions and moral dilemmas. One notable instance occurs in "Doctor Doom: The Lord of
                Latveria," where he uses his intellect and sorcery to glimpse into the future.<br>
                <br>
                During these visions, he sees countless potential futures but finds that the only one where humanity
                thrives is one where he is in control.

            <h3 id="headline">Bio:</h3>
            <p align=left>Equal parts super-genius and megalomaniac, Victor von Doom better answers to the
                self-proclaimed moniker of Doctor Doom, the despotic ruler of the Eastern European nation of Latveria.
                Victor was born in a Romani camp, the son of a witch named Cynthia, who died after making a deal with
                the demon Mephisto. Swearing revenge, Victor spent his life honing his skills in both science and magic.
                In his academic youth, Doom was the college rival of Reed Richards, future leader of the Fantastic Four
                as Mister Fantastic. When left scarred by a machine meant to make contact with his late mother, a
                disgraced Doom roamed the world until he was taken in by a tribe of Tibetan monks, who helped him forge
                a suit of armor topped off by an iron mask to hide his face. Rechristened Doctor Doom, Victor returned
                to his homeland, using his lifetime of skills to seize power as its new ruler.<br>
                <br>
                Although Doom wishes to bring order and betterment to humanity, he intends to enforce this goal by his
                own hand and with an iron fist. Ruthless and prideful, Doctor Doom has come into conflict with the
                super hero community at large, but the Fantastic Four remain his biggest enemies due to Victor's shared
                history with and personal vendetta against Mister Fantastic, whom he blames for the accident that cost
                him his face. Victor is not without allies, like his adoptive son Kristoff Vernard, or his
                personal champion, Victorious. Doom has had several brushes with great power, stealing it from
                beings such as the Silver Surfer, the Beyonder and the Scarlet Witch. In his greatest
                triumph, he took the nigh-omnipotence of the Beyonders and reshaped the remains of the destroyed
                Multiverse into Battleworld, holding supreme power as God Emperor until his ultimate downfall and the
                restoration of all there was by the hand of Mister Fantastic.<br>
                <br>
                In recent times, Doctor Doom proved a key player in stopping a worldwide vampire invasion orchestrated
                by the ancient evil of Varnae, who plunged the Earth into an endless night by enveloping the planet with
                Darkforce. Doom helped an incapacitated Doctor Strange to dispel the Darkforce in temporary exchange
                for the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme. However, Doom refused to give up the mantle following Earth's
                liberation, seeing that he had much more work to do before he believed the world to be safe in his own
                eyes.
